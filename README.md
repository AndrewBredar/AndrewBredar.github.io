Hello stranger! This is the repository for my personal website, an ongoing project where I use the skills I've learned through various resources (like web development bootcamps) to show off who I am, my academic background, my interests, and the various projects I've worked on.

I created the website using HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.

Thank you for visitng my GitHub.
